Othello rules: 

Black and white pieces. 

Board is denoted a-h columns left to right, and 1-8 for rows, top to bottom. 

Pieces are called stones. 
Start off with white in D4 and E5, and black in D5 and E4. 

If you place a piece and it sandwiches your opponents piece or pieces inbetween 2 of your pieces, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, you must flip their pieces to your color. 

A piece can only be played if it will flip an opponent's.

If there are no options, your turn passes, and the opponent goes again. 

When the board is filled, or neither player has a legal move, the game is over. 

The winner is the player with the most pieces in their color.
